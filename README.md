Proposal
- What problem does your app solve? Too many funny (salty) comments to sift through. It identifies trending trolls :)
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? User will be able to see saltiest comments from searched HN Users
- What is the mission statement? Just for gits and shiggles. (ks)

Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
DS: Decide freq/vol, rank users, deliver to team
WEB:Landing page, user creation and auth, save and delete comments by user
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
Browse saltiest topics (wordcloud)
Share favorite trolls to social media (twitter etc)
Maybe assign pictures of our favorite troll, the gold silver and bronze troll awards or something to that effect? (ks)
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
HN Users, 
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How? How indeed




Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
Formik, Redux/Context APIs, Pandas, SQLite3, SASS, LESS, Style Components, ReactStrap, Tensorflow, Keras, ResNET(?), SKlearn, Wordcloud, Pandas, Perhaps Plotly, Seaborn, or some other type of data visualization.
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
	Not that I have found as of yet. However, if we use BigQuery, we do need to get authentication. (ks)
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
	I hope not.(ks)
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
	I am on a windows machine, so I haven’t considered using anything that starts with Apple (ks).
        For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
   Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed
